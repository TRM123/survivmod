 # FAQ
 
 Q: Can you change bullet damage/health/movespeed/etc?
 
 A: No, those are handled by the server and I cannot change them
 
 Q: When is the aimbot coming out?
 
 A: I don't know, whenever I feel like making it
 
 Q: Zoom is kind of glitchy, what do I do?
 
 A: Due to how the game loads things around you, at lower scope levels the edge of your vision will be a bit choppy. Pick up a better scope and it will go away.
 
 Q: How does this work exactly?
 
 A: This is a simple modification of the client side java script file for the site, allowing us to make client side changes to the game
 
 Q: Can I get banned?
 
 A: Theoreticly no, as the game has no way to tell that there has been a javascript change. However no promises
 
 Q: I have a suggestion! What should I do?
 
 A: Create a new issue and I will tell you how feasible it will be to implement
